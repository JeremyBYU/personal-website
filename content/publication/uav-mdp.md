abstract = "This paper presents a strategy for optimal estimation of parameters for towed cable systems using moving horizon estimation (MHE). The main contributions of the work include a novel formulation of MHE using a dead-band that explicitly rejects measurement noise, real-time implementation results, and the investigation of time varying stochastic disturbances as well as unknown yet constant disturbances. In addition to the real-time results, an offline multi-objective optimization is conducted to reveal the tradeoff between the computational burden and estimation variation. A Pareto frontier is used to demonstrate a series of optimal experimental configurations obtained by adjusting the model complexity (number of cable links and horizon steps). Finally, a multivariate parameter estimation is performed to explore the applicability of the proposed approach in simultaneously estimating multiple parameters."
