# Biography

I develop and use technology to solve complex problems in the automation industry. I enjoy working in hardware and software while also modeling the physical systems I aim to control. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Robotics at the University of Michigan, specializing in autonomous decision making. Prior I worked as a control systems engineer in the oil and gas industry for three years.

I am adept with many control systems, safety systems, and general control technology. I am proficient in more than a dozen programming languages and am an active learner. In addition, I am a self taught web developer with a deep understanding of JavaScript and the ecosystem of tooling used both on the server and frontend.
